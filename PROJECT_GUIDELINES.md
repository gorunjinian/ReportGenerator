The project will be built using Python as the programming language with all the necessary libraries to turn a csv file into a well formatted PDF report in a fixed and given format
The format guidelines are as follows:
1. The PDF will have 2 logos at the top of the PDF's first page, one in each corner, the logos are .jpg images named "CER Logo" and "Biladi logo" respectively
2. The PDF should be formatted into clear divided sections with each section starting with its corresponding titles
3. The report will always contain the same input categories such as Date, Assessor's name, Location, and then the different damage and report assessment sections
